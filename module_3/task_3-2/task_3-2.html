      <li>[In part 1, is it possible to solve the problem using a single "for" loop?]</li>
      <p>[I think you can do it with an if and else sentence. I think it will not be possible otherwise.]</p>
      <li>[In part 2, can we create what is known as an "infinite" loop within the condition of the "while" loop?
        Describe what would or would not be necessary to achieve this. Provide a thorough explanation of
        your answer.]</li>
      <p>[An infinite loop could happen If you switch the number 60 to lesser than 45, the whole thing will try to guess but it can't. It will try to find 45 in a number lesser than 45, and that is not possible.]</p>
      <li>[Discuss briefly how quickly or slowly a computer might be able to compute this, considering the
        number of guesses and the time it takes. How does the program behave while it is guessing? Can
        the program perform other tasks concurrently?]</li>
      <p>[If the program tries to find 45 in a number lesser than 45, it will try to find 45 in an infinite loop. It will never find 45, it will either freeze or crash while trying]</p>
      <li>[Explain the relationship between rows and columns in nested "for" loops. Can we, for instance,
        change the order, considering rows to be innermost or columns to be innermost, or does this not
        matter?]</li>
      <p>[Rows go in an horizontal line and columns go in a vertical line. You can change the order, like in part 5. it goes first in in row then after it will go in column]</p>
