      <li>Discuss the behavior of part 1, What happens when the wake-up time is not 7 and what happens when it is exactly 7?</li>
      <p>[When the wake up time is not 7 it would say I cannot take the bus. If it is 7 I can take the bus.]</p>
      <li>Same as question #1. How ever the answer should now be different. Discuss the behaviour of part 2, What happens when the wake-up time is not 7 and what happens when it is exactly 7?</li>
      <p>[When the wake up time is not 7 it would say I can take the car. If it is 7 i can take the bus.]</p>
      <li>Discuss the behavior of part 3, what happens when wake time is less than 7 or greater than 8?</li>
      <p>[When the wake up time is less than 7 then it would say I can take the car. If the wake up time is greater than 8 it would say I can take the train.]</p>
      <li>Discuss the behavior for part 4, what happens if the number is exactly 0, is zero positive or negative?</li>
    </ol>
    [On part 4, What happens is that it would show nothing. It's not positive or negative it's just nothing. Are we talking about part 5 then it would show the number is zero.]
